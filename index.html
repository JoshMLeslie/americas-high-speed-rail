				The intention of this page is to document, with sufficient information
				to leverage in construction planning, a multi-country/continent
				high-speed rail system, connecting Canada, The USA, Mexico, and South
				America with the goal of enhancing socio-economic conditions across
				these regions and, in turn, globally.
			</p>
			<p>
				While passenger rail is a major focus of HSR, for conventional rail,
				freight shipping overshadows it 4 to 1 [<a
					href="https://www.aar.org/data-center/"
					>AAR</a
				>, proper citation needed] and should be examined as the major source of
				investment for long distance HSR while passenger rail requirements are
				reserved for intercity/state transit. In other words, long distances for
				freight, short distances for passengers.

				“We don't need more maps. That is not our problem. What we need is
				someone who has the power to translate map into steel and concrete—a
				five- and 10-year plan with funding and someone saying what's
				happening.”
